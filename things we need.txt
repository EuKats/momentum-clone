the cancel button to redirect to the input page and give a variable "canceled" true
in it so I can check if the user chose to stay logged out or not for the session.

the username input field once completed correctly needs to save the value in a variable(<---- I will do that) and then after the user types the password
we need to redirect to the index with the user logged in. We need to do this because in the original app 
the user enters the username and then another page appears where he is asked to enter the password.

the logout button needs to redirect to the index with the user logged of but the "canceled" variable set to true.

the login button of the page needs to redirect to the page without the user as well but the canceled variable set to false;

I need an  option to choose the first time page loads something like we have "user" now, to say if(firstload) .... that's optional.

when you put something invalid in the login I want it to redirect to the index again not the login page;
